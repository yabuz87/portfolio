# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Welcome to my portfolio website! You can view it live [here](https://yabuz87.github.io/portfolio).

Thanks to the powerful capabilities of GitHub, Iâ€™ve managed to deploy my portfolio while continuing to work on it. Although it's still a work in progress (I plan to add more styling and features), you can explore it in its current state.

### What's Next?

- **Styling**: Further enhance the visual aesthetics of the site.
- **Additional Features**: Implement new functionalities to improve user experience.

Stay tuned for updates!
